### Design Patterns

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. They are elegant solutions to repeating problems

Design Patterns have 3 categories:

- Creational (different ways to create objects)
- Structural (configure relationship between objects)
- Behavioural (identify levels of interaction between objects)
